=Introduction

Simy is a simple yearly yield calculator for rental properties.  It takes the annual rent and initial costs of buying the property as input and returns the yearly yield by using the following equation.

yearly yield = annual rent / initial costs


=Technology

Simy is a Rails app (Rails 4.1.6) and uses PostgreSQL database (in production).

Notable gems and components that it uses are:

 * Twitter Bootstrap (version 3.3.1) for the front-end

 * Devise for user authentication
 
 * Font Awesome for scalable vector icons


=Heroku

Simy runs on the Heroku platform. A SendGrid Heroku add-on is used for sending e-mails.


=TO-DO

 * Carry out simple form validations in JavaScript; fewer trips to the server the better â€“ it saves the user the bandwidth; keeps the unnecessary and trivial processing in the browser and keeps the server costs down.
     
 * Test cases in the controllers. This was dropped out due to incompatibility issues with the shoulda gem. Needs further investigation.

 * Auto-complete the address based on the post code entered.

 * Allow multiple calculations on the same post code (e.g. for two rental properties having the same post code.)

 * Provide the ability to view the price of properties around the post code entered and provide a downloadable report.

 * Provide guess access that allows the user to calculate the simple yield. This will be a JavaScript front-end development. Offer more complex calculations for the registered users.
